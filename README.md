# Mall Customer Data Cleaning

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset using Python and Pandas.

## 📌Dataset Description
The raw dataset which contained CustomerID,Gender,Age,Annual Income(k$),Spending Score(1-100) was cleaned to remove missing values and duplicate entries. Text fields were standardized (like the Gender column), and column names were reformatted for consistency. Data types were corrected for key numeric fields such as age, annual income, and spending score. The final cleaned data is saved as `Mall_Customers_Cleaned.csv` and is ready for analysis or machine learning tasks.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab

## 📁 Files Included
- `mall_customer_cleaning.ipynb` – Notebook containing the full cleaning process  
- `Mall_Customers_Cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset file  
- `README.md` – Project overview

## ✅ Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the raw dataset  
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Cleaned and standardized text and column names
- Renamed columns  
- Converted data types  
- Saved cleaned output for analysis
- Exported the cleaned dataset

## 📊 Future Work
- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)
